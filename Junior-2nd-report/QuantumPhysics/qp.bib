abstract = {We present an algorithm for solving in parallel the Eikonal equation. The efficiency of our approach is rooted in the ordering and distribution of the grid points on the available processors; we utilize a Cuthill–McKee ordering. The advantages of our approach is that (1) the efficiency does not plateau for a large number of threads; we compare our approach to the current state-of-the-art parallel implementation of Zhao (2007) [14] and (2) the total number of iterations needed for convergence is the same as that of a sequential implementation, i.e. our parallel implementation does not increase the complexity of the underlying sequential algorithm. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the efficiency of our approach.}
