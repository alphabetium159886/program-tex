abstract = {Radio over Fiber (RoF) systems form a crucial component of fifth generation (5G)
 mobile phone networks targeting higher capacity and better cost effectiveness in the existing 
 telecommunication system architecture. An enhanced 32 channel 256 Gbps DWDM based RoF optical system 
 incorporating DCF and FBG as dispersion compensators has been analyzed in Optisystem software, 
 capable to transmit data at 8 Gbps per channel offering optimum signal reception over distances of 60 km and 120 km. 
 Maximum Q factors of 15.34 and 15.97 were obtained for narrowed 50 GHz channel spacing for 60 km and 120 km 
 respectively in 32 channel mode. The proposed system delivered very high Q factor of around 79 for 50 GHz channel 
 spacing when operated in 8 channel mode at 4 Gbps per channel bit rate. Appreciable FWM side band power level reduction 
 of average 6 dBm was also shown from the obtained spectrums. The transmission quality for long haul traversal (120 km) 
 and constricted channel spacing (50 GHz) was observed to be much better than the existing WDM-RoF architectures.}
