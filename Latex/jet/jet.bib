abstract = {We study the deviations to be expected at high energies from the recently observed two-jet structure of hadronic final states in e+e− annihilation. Motivated by the approximate validity of the naïve parton model and by asymptotic freedom, we suggest that hard gluon bremsstrahlung may be the dominant source of hadrons with large momenta transverse to the main jet axes. This process should give rise to three-jet final states. These may be observable at the highest SPEAR or DORIS energies, and should be important at the higher PETRA or PEP energies.}
